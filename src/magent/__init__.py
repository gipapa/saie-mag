# This file makes 'magent' a Python package.
# You can optionally import symbols from submodules here
# to make them available at the package level.

# For example, if you want to be able to write `from magent import Role`
# instead of `from magent.types import Role`, you can do:
# from .types import Role, AgentCard, Message, Task, etc.

# Or, to import all names from types.py (use with caution to avoid namespace pollution):
# from .types import *
