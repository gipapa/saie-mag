# This file makes 'src' a Python package.
# You can leave this file empty or use it to
# make submodules more accessible. For example:
# from .magent import types # Assuming magent is a submodule of src

# If you want to directly access, e.g., `src.Role`
# after `from .magent.types import Role` in `src/magent/__init__.py`
# and then `from .magent import Role` here, that's also possible.
# However, typically, you'd either keep this empty or manage
# imports for modules directly under 'src' if any.
